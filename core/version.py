"""
DishtaYantra Version Information
================================

Single source of truth for the application version. Every module, template,
banner, and document must reference this module rather than hard-coding a
version string.

Version 2.2 highlights:
    - FastAPI web layer (replacing Flask) served by uvicorn, with full
      light/dark theming and locally-vendored front-end assets
    - Pluggable storage abstraction (FileSystem / S3 / Azure Blob / GCS)
    - Database-backed users, roles, and API keys (SQLAlchemy DAO layer,
      SQLite default with PostgreSQL switchable via configuration)
    - Configurable HA Manager (Zookeeper / S3 / Redis / Socket providers),
      with the active role surfaced in the navbar on every page
    - Format-agnostic configuration (YAML or .properties) with
      ${VAR:default} resolution and env / command-line overrides
    - AWS (SQS / Kinesis / SNS) and Azure (Service Bus / Event Hubs)
      managed-messaging pub/sub, plus S3 / Azure Blob / GCS object stores
    - Market-aware scheduling: time windows with duration syntax,
      day-of-week allow/deny lists, and USA / Canada holiday calendars
    - Resilient wrappers for REST, SQL, Aerospike, gRPC, and cloud messaging
    - Greatly expanded automated test coverage
