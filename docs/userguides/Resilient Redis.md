## Key Features:

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Fully compatible with `redis.Redis`, all existing code works without modification
2. **Automatic Reconnection**: Handles connection failures with configurable retry logic
3. **Command Buffering**: Optional buffering of commands during connection outages to prevent data loss
4. **Resilient Pipeline**: Custom pipeline implementation with retry logic for batch operations
5. **Pub/Sub Support**: Automatic restoration of subscriptions after reconnection

## Configuration Parameters:

- `reconnect_tries`: Maximum reconnection attempts (default: 10)
- `reconnect_interval_seconds`: Sleep between retries (default: 60 seconds)
- `buffer_commands`: Enable/disable command buffering (default: True)
- `buffer_max_commands`: Maximum commands to buffer (default: 10,000)

## Key Components:

### Enhanced Features:

1. **Command Buffering**:
   - Optional feature to prevent data loss
   - Background thread processes buffered commands when reconnected
   - Configurable buffer size with overflow handling

2. **Resilient Pipeline**:
   - Batch operations with automatic retry
   - Transaction support maintained
   - Command stack preserved across reconnection attempts

3. **Pub/Sub Resilience**:
   - Tracks active subscriptions
   - Automatically restores channel and pattern subscriptions
   - Maintains callback associations

4. **Connection Management**:
   - Automatic connection health checks
   - Graceful connection pool management
   - Thread-safe reconnection logic

## Usage Examples:

```python
# Simple drop-in replacement
client = ResilientRedisClient(
    host='localhost',
    port=6379,
    reconnect_tries=5,
    reconnect_interval_seconds=30,
    buffer_commands=True  # Enable command buffering
)

# All Redis commands work as normal with added resilience
client.set('key', 'value')
value = client.get('key')

# Pipeline operations with automatic retry
with client.pipeline() as pipe:
    pipe.set('key1', 'value1')
    pipe.set('key2', 'value2')
    pipe.incr('counter')
    results = pipe.execute()  # Automatically retried on failure

# Commands are buffered during outages
for i in range(1000):
    client.set(f'key{i}', f'value{i}')
    # No data lost even if Redis goes down!

# Monitor buffer status
if client.get_buffer_size() > 0:
    print(f"Buffered commands: {client.get_buffer_size()}")

client.close()
```

## Key Benefits:

1. **Zero Data Loss Option**: Command buffering ensures operations aren't lost during outages
2. **Seamless Recovery**: Automatic reconnection without application restart
3. **Production Ready**: Thread-safe with comprehensive error handling
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in methods to check buffer size and failed commands
5. **Full Compatibility**: Works with all Redis data types and operations
6. **Transaction Support**: WATCH/MULTI/EXEC operations preserved
7. **Pub/Sub Resilience**: Subscriptions automatically restored

## Special Features:

- **Configurable Buffering**: Can be disabled for read-heavy workloads where buffering isn't needed
- **Pipeline Resilience**: Batch operations automatically retried as a unit
- **Method Interception**: All Redis methods automatically gain retry capabilities
- **Connection Health Checks**: Proactive connection validation before operations

The implementation ensures your Redis applications remain resilient to server restarts, network issues, and temporary outages while maintaining full compatibility with the standard `redis.Redis` client.
