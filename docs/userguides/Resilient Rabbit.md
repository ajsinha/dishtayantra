The `ResilientRabbitBlockingConnection` class extends `pika.BlockingConnection` with automatic reconnection and message buffering capabilities for RabbitMQ.It is a comprehensive `ResilientRabbitBlockingConnection` class that extends `pika.BlockingConnection` with automatic reconnection and message buffering capabilities. Here are the key features:

## Key Features:

1. **Drop-in Replacement**: Extends `pika.BlockingConnection` and maintains full compatibility with existing code
2. **Resilient Channels**: Custom `ResilientChannel` wrapper that automatically restores channel state after reconnection
3. **Message Buffering**: Prevents message loss by buffering during connection outages
4. **State Restoration**: Automatically restores exchanges, queues, bindings, QoS settings, and consumers after reconnection

## Configuration Parameters:

- `reconnect_tries`: Maximum reconnection attempts (default: 10)
- `reconnect_interval_seconds`: Sleep between retries (default: 60 seconds)
- `buffer_max_messages`: Maximum messages to buffer (default: 10,000)

## Key Components:

### ResilientChannel
A wrapper around `pika.Channel` that:
- Tracks all channel operations (exchanges, queues, bindings, consumers)
- Automatically restores state after reconnection
- Provides resilient versions of all channel methods

### Enhanced Features:

1. **Automatic State Restoration**:
   - Exchange declarations
   - Queue declarations
   - Queue bindings
   - QoS settings
   - Consumer callbacks

2. **Message Safety**:
   - Automatic message buffering during outages
   - Background thread for processing buffered messages
   - No message loss during reconnection

3. **Resilient Operations**:
   - All channel operations wrapped with retry logic
   - Automatic reconnection on connection/channel failures
   - Thread-safe operations

## Usage Examples:

```python
# Simple drop-in replacement
connection = ResilientRabbitBlockingConnection(
    parameters=pika.ConnectionParameters('localhost'),
    reconnect_tries=5,
    reconnect_interval_seconds=30
)

channel = connection.channel()

# Declare resources (automatically restored after reconnection)
channel.exchange_declare(exchange='my_exchange', exchange_type='direct')
channel.queue_declare(queue='my_queue', durable=True)
channel.queue_bind(exchange='my_exchange', queue='my_queue')

# Publish messages - automatically buffered during outages
for i in range(1000):
    channel.basic_publish(
        exchange='my_exchange',
        routing_key='my_queue',
        body=f'Message {i}'.encode()
    )
    # No messages lost even if RabbitMQ goes down!

# Consumer with auto-restoration
def callback(ch, method, properties, body):
    print(f"Received: {body}")
    ch.basic_ack(delivery_tag=method.delivery_tag)

channel.basic_consume(queue='my_queue', on_message_callback=callback)
channel.start_consuming()  # Consumer automatically restored after reconnection
```

## Key Benefits:

1. **Zero Message Loss**: Buffering ensures messages aren't lost during outages
2. **Seamless Recovery**: Automatic restoration of all channel state
3. **Production Ready**: Thread-safe with comprehensive error handling
4. **Monitoring**: Built-in methods to check buffer size and failed messages
5. **Compatibility**: Works as a drop-in replacement for existing pika code

The implementation ensures your RabbitMQ applications remain resilient to broker restarts, network issues, and temporary outages while maintaining all the functionality of the standard `pika.BlockingConnection`.
